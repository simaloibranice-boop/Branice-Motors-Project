                We connect consumers directly with sellers to ensure quality
                and reliability. Consumers select vehicles based on many attributes
                including vehicle features, availability, purchase price, expected 
                cost of ownership, and available incentives. It is commonly assumed 
                that most consumers want something that is stylish,
                affordable, fuel efficient, powerful, comfortable, and safe vehicles.
